# Ecosystem Evaluation System

Ecosystem is used to describe the health status of open source community standing from ecology context. We create a [three-dimensional space for the evaluation system](https://compass.gitee.com/zh/blog/2023/12/09/open-source-eco2/open-source-eco2), including the open source ecosystem, "collaboration, people, software" and evaluation models.

# Dimensions

## [**Collaboration - Productivity**](./collaboration/productivity/README.md)
Definition: The efficiency with which an ecosystem or project converts inputs into output.

Metrics Model Names | Descriptions 
--- | --- 
[Collaboration Development Index](./collaboration/productivity/collaboration-development-index.md#collaboration-development-index) | Use proxy metrics to evaluate how well the development process is managed and how well the community is doing with collaborative development.
[Community Service and Support](./collaboration/productivity/community-service-and-support.md#community-service-and-support) | It measures the quality of services and support provided by the community as directly perceived by a developer during the contribution process.

## [**Collaboration - Robustness**](./collaboration/robustness/README.md)
Definition: The capability of an ecosystem or project to face and survive disruptions.

Metrics Model Names | Descriptions 
--- | --- 
[Activity](./collaboration/robustness/activity.md#activity) | Community Activity is used to describe how active an open source community is.


## [**Collaboration - Niche Creation**](./collaboration/niche-creation/README.md)
Definition: The capacity to create and recognize meaningful diversity and thereby new capabilities.

Metrics Model Names | Descriptions 
--- | --- 
[Organizations Activity](./collaboration/niche-creation/organization-activity.md#organizations-activity) | It is used to describe how active organizations are in a community.

## [**People-Productivity**](./people/productivity/README.md)

定义：The efficiency with which an ecosystem or project converts inputs into output.

Metrics Model Names | Descriptions 
--- | --- 
| [Contributor Domain Persona](./people/productivity/contributor-domain-persona.md) |  |
