# CII Best Practices Badge

The CII Best Practices Badge is a certification provided by the OpenSSF to assess whether an open source project adopts a set of security-focused best development practices. Through a systematic evaluation, the badge helps projects identify and improve the security and quality aspects of their development processes.

# Metrics Model

## Badge Level

| Badge Level | Definition | Score | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gold Badge | The project meets all gold criteria | 10 | A significant achievement for the project, requiring participation from multiple developers |
| Silver Badge | The project meets all silver criteria | 7 | The project has reached a high level of security practice |
| Passing Badge | The project meets all passing criteria | 5 | Even achieving the passing standard is a significant accomplishment |
| In Progress | The project is working towards a passing badge | 2 | The project is actively improving its development practices |

## Assessment Criteria

The OpenSSF Best Practices badge has three levels: passing, silver, and gold. We award full points to projects that meet the [gold criteria](https://www.bestpractices.dev/criteria/2), which is a significant achievement that requires the involvement of multiple developers in the project.

Lower scores represent projects that have met the silver criteria, the passing criteria, or are working towards a passing badge, with scores increasing as more criteria are met. It is important to note that even meeting the passing criteria is a significant achievement.

## Data Source

The data for this metric is queried from [https://www.bestpractices.dev/](https://www.bestpractices.dev/), and the project's badge status is obtained through the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge API.
